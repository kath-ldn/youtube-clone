# YOUTUBE DUPE USING ONLY HTML/CSS

This is a basic replica of Youtube using only HTML and CSS, to refresh my understanding of positioning elements including video and images on a webpage. This is part of The Odin Project HTML and CSS module.

## Known issues
- Currently when resizing the thumbnails section falls after the video column rather than before.
- Responsiveness could be improved - the video doesn't fill the whole page when resizing, for example.
- Both of these issues are to do with Responsiveness - to revisit in learning.
