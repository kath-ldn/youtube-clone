# Youtube Clone

## About

This is basic replica of Youtube using only HTML and CSS, which I built as part of [The Odin Project HTML and CSS module](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video). The objective of this was to refresh my understanding of positioning elements, specifically images and videos.

### Live Demo

[GitHub pages](https://kath-ldn.github.io/youtube-clone/)

### Built with

HTML & CSS.

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Roadmap

None planned - this was a learning project

### Known Issues

* I didn't use a reset sheet - this may lead to some issues in different browsers (I'm using Chrome).
* I built this before I covered grid/flexbox in detail, and responsive layouts - so the responsiveness is not perfect.
  * For example, in actual Youtube the Thumbnails (right) section falls under the video rather than under the comments when the screen is narroweed below 1015px. If I were to re-do this I would either use grid to allow me to re-order items, or have the relevant sections in one Flexbox and change the flex order.
* Icons used are low quality jpgs rather than SVGs/sprites used on Youtube so they aren't optimal quality. If I were doing this again I would use the proper SVGs/sprites (finding them using Dev Tools).
